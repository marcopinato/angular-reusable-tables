<h1>Duplicating code</h1>
<p>
  In this example, tables are duplicated: each one is a copy-pasted version of
  another, with minor changes. Don't do this: duplication means that you will
  fix bugs and add features in multiple places. Once your application starts
  growing, this structure will slow you down.

<app-cars-table></app-cars-table>
